   'incentive_title'=>'INCENTIVE TRAVEL',
   'incentive_text_az'=>'Incentive travel is an important subset of the Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) industry. It is effectively a travel perk used to incentivize or motivate employees or partners. It is often tied to company goals or top performers.
   In this report from the University of Central Florida Rosen College of Hospitality Management, Goldblatt and Nelson define an incentive event as “a corporate sponsored meeting or trip to reward effort and create company loyalty, often built around a theme; and a celebratory event intended to showcase persons who meet or exceed sales or production goals.”
   However you define it, employee rewards are changing—gone are the days when holiday bonuses were enough to provide year-round motivation. Now, it’s all about non-monetary incentives, and the predictions for 2020 by the Incentive Revenue Foundation (IRF) support that idea.',
